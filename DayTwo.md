# My frontend Developer Journey  (Day Two)
## HTML

## Hypertext Markup Language know as HTML is the standard markup language fpor document designed to be displayed in a web browser . 
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheet and scripting language such as javascript  and it was designed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.


## Kindly take note that :
* HTML is not a programming language
* It is the building block of the web
* Files must end with the html extension
* index.html is the root or homepage of a website
* HTML does not need a server to operate

# BLOCK- LEVEL ELEMENT
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
The <div> element is a block-level element.

# INLINE- LEVEL ELEMENT
An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.
