Windows 10 is a series of operating systems developed by Microsoft and released as  part of iys Windows NT family of operating systems.

Microsoft initially aimed to have windows 10 installed on over a billion devices within three years of its release, that goal was ultimately reached almost five years later on March 16, 2020. By January 2018, windows 10 surpasses windows 7 as the most popular version of windows worldwide and by May 2020, windows 10 surpassed windows 7 as the most popular version of windows in China.
